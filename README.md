# Heisenberg c2 V0.4.1
**Why is it called Heisenberg c2? Heisenberg made meth, and like using meth, using this C2 isn't a good choice.**
 
## Features
|Feature|Use|
|----|-----|
|whoami|Find current user|
|reverse shell|Execute commands|
|tasklist|List tasks|
|wget|Upload files|
|rm|Delete files|
|schtasks|Maintain access|
|ls|List files|
|cat|Read files|
|pwd|Find current directory|
|exit|Exit server or/and client|
#### Note: the server doesn't execute such commands (besides schtasks), but the commands have similar/the same functions
### About
Just another C2.
### Future plans
By V1.0, this C2 will have a builder, and a pre-compiled server. V2.0 will be focused on adding more advanced features, such as keylogging. V3.0 will be focused on active directory, network scanning, and exploitation/scanning of exploits like zerologon and printnightmare. V4.0 will be focused on avoiding edr detection. At most, I think I'll get to V2.0 if this project doesn't take off. Please help me by reviewing my code!
